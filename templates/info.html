				<p>Depression is a medical condition that affects your mood and ability to function. Depressive symptoms
					include feeling sad, anxious or hopeless. </p>The condition can also cause difficulty with thinking,
				memory, eating and sleeping. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder (clinical depression) means you
				have felt sad,
				low or worthless most days for at least two weeks while also having other symptoms such as sleep
				problems, loss of interest in activities, or change in appetite.
				Without treatment, depression can get worse and last longer. In severe cases, it can lead to self-harm
				or death. Fortunately, treatments can be very effective in improving symptoms
				of depression.

			<p>Healthcare providers name depression types according to symptoms and causes. These episodes often have no
				obvious cause. In some people, they can linger much longer than in others for no clear reason.
			</p>
			<p>Types of depression include:</p>
			<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD): Major depression (clinical depression) has intense or overwhelming
				symptoms that last longer than two weeks. These symptoms interfere with everyday life.</p>
			<p>Bipolar depression: People with bipolar disorder have alternating periods of low mood and extremely
				high-energy (manic) periods. During the low period, they may have depression symptoms such as feeling
				sad or hopeless or lacking energy.</p>
			<p>Perinatal and postpartum depression: “Perinatal” means around birth. Many people refer to this type as
				postpartum depression. Perinatal depression can occur during pregnancy and up to one year after having a
				baby. Symptoms go beyond “the baby blues,” which causes minor sadness, worry or stress.</p>
			<p>Persistent depressive disorder (PDD): PDD is also known as dysthymia. Symptoms of PDD are less severe
				than major depression. But people experience PDD symptoms for two years or longer.</p>
			<p>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of premenstrual
				disorder (PMS). It affects women in the days or weeks leading up to their menstrual period.</p>
			<p>Psychotic depression: People with psychotic depression have severe depressive symptoms and delusions or
				hallucinations. Delusions are beliefs in things that are not based in reality, while hallucinations
				involve seeing, hearing, or feeling touched by things that aren’t actually there.</p>
			<p>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): Seasonal depression, or seasonal affective disorder, usually starts in
				late fall and early winter. It often goes away during the spring and summer.</p>

				<p>Everyone may feel sad or down from time to time. However, clinical depression has more intense
					symptoms that last two weeks or longer.</p>
				<p>To determine whether you have clinical depression, your healthcare provider will ask questions. You
					may complete a questionnaire and provide a family history. Your healthcare provider may also perform
					an exam or order lab tests to see if you have another medical condition.

			<p>Depression can be serious, but it’s also treatable. Treatment for depression includes:</p>
			<p>1. Self-help: Regular exercise, getting enough sleep, and spending time with people you care about can
				improve depression symptoms.</p>
			<p>2. Counseling: Counseling or psychotherapy is talking with a mental health professional. Your counselor
				helps you address your problems and develop coping skills. Sometimes brief therapy is all you need.
				Other people continue therapy longer.</p>
			<p>3. Alternative medicine: People with mild depression or ongoing symptoms can improve their well-being
				with complementary therapy. Therapy may include massage, acupuncture, hypnosis and biofeedback.</p>
			<p>4. Medication: Prescription medicine called antidepressants can help change brain chemistry that causes
				depression. Antidepressants can take a few weeks to have an effect. Some antidepressants have side
				effects, which often improve with time. If they don’t, talk to your provider. A different medication may
				work better for you.</p>
			<p>5. Brain stimulation therapy: Brain stimulation therapy can help people who have severe depression or
				depression with psychosis. Types of brain stimulation therapy include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT),
				transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).
